                    <h2>The Last of Us</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Last of Us is a post-apocalyptic action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog. The game
                        follows Joel and Ellie, two survivors in a world that has been devastated by a fungal infection
                        that has turned most of the human population into aggressive creatures. As they journey across
                        the country, they must rely on each other to survive and overcome various obstacles, both human
                        and infected. The game received widespread critical acclaim for its story, characters, and
                        gameplay, and has since been remastered for newer consoles.
